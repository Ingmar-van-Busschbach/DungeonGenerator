/// <summary>
/// Centralized gizmo/debug-drawing call aggregator for Unity.
/// </summary>
/// 
/// <remarks>
/// Unity requires gizmo drawing to occur inside <see cref="MonoBehaviour.OnDrawGizmos"/> (or related gizmo callbacks).
/// In larger projects, that can lead to many scattered components each implementing their own gizmo methods.

/// This utility class provides a simple way for arbitrary systems to enqueue gizmo draw calls
/// and have them all executed from a single OnDrawGizmos entry point.
///
/// How it’s meant to be used:
/// - Any code can request a named batcher via <see cref="GetInstance(string)"/>.
/// - That code can then enqueue gizmo drawing work with <see cref="BatchCall(Action)"/>.
/// - When Unity calls <see cref="OnDrawGizmos"/>, the “root” instance draws *all* enqueued calls across all batchers.
///
/// Important behavior:
/// - The first-created instance becomes the global "root". Only the root actually executes drawing.
/// - Additional instances exist only to hold separate queues (channels) of calls.
/// - Calls remain enqueued until cleared via <see cref="ClearAllBatchedCalls"/> (or until domain reload / quit).
///
/// Lifetime and scene impact
/// - Instances are created as new <see cref="GameObject"/>s named "DebugDrawingBatcher_{pName}".
/// - They are not parented, hidden, or marked as DontDestroyOnLoad in this version.
///   This means they will exist in the active scene and may accumulate if not managed carefully.
/// - The static collections are cleared in <see cref="OnApplicationQuit"/>, but note that Unity Editor domain reload
///   / assembly reload behavior can differ from player quit behavior.
///
/// Threading:
/// This class is not thread-safe. Enqueue calls from the Unity main thread only.
///
/// Performance:
/// The work executed is whatever you enqueue. If you enqueue many calls or expensive logic, editor scene view drawing may become slow.
/// </remarks>
